Please run the following commands in the command line

cd to/the/location/of/NS_Installer.jar
java -jar NS_Installer.jar

This will run the installer, witch will look for the executable.
If it does not find the executable, it asks the user to give the path to the executable.
After the executable is found, the program will ask for a directory where to put the necessary
executable and everything else the game needs.
If want the source code, it can be found here:

NOTE: In some circumstances it may crash. If it crashes, if the world was loaded, it saves the
world and writes a .log file. Please create a new issue labeled bug in the github repostory and I will try my best to
get it fixed in the next update, and send the contents of the .log file to, since they are essential
to fixing the issue. The .log file does not contain any information about the user, just information to help me track down the issue/bug.
