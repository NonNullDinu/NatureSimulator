    Please run the following commands in the command line

<pre>cd to/the/location/of/NS_Installer.jar
    java -jar NS_Installer.jar</pre>

This will run the installer. The program will ask for a directory
where to put the necessary executable and everything else the game needs.

NOTE: In some circumstances it may crash. If it crashes, if the world was loaded, it saves the
world and writes a .log file. Please create a new issue labeled bug in the github repostory and I will try my best
to
get it fixed in the next update, and send the contents of the .log file to, since they are essential
to fixing the issue. The .log file does not contain any information about the user, just information to help me
track
down the issue/bug.

IMPORTANT: THE LAST WINDOWS VERSION IS 1.1.9. IT HAS BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER BRANCH, AND IS DEVELOPED BY SOMEONE ELSE,
SO
IT MAY NOT HAVE
ALL THE FEAUTURES IMPLEMENTED YET. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOURSELF A VERSION FROM THE LATEST CODE, THEN THIS IS
OPEN-SOURCE
AND THERE IS NS*.*.*.jar,
WHICH CONTAINS THE COMPILED CODE, BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT IT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK.

If you want the source code, it can be found here:
